A package for scanning IBANs  (international bank account numbers) with the help of the smartphone camera and Google's ml kit.

## Inspired by

This package is heavily inspired by the package [google_ml_kit](https://pub.dev/packages/google_ml_kit) and their great examples.

## Usage

Add this package as dependency in your pubspec.yaml.

```dart
dependencies:
    flutter_iban_scanner:
```

Import the package.

```dart
import 'package:flutter_iban_scanner/flutter_iban_scanner.dart';
```

Call the `IBANScannerView` widget and provide an `onScannerResult` callback for handling the result of the scanner.

```dart
IBANScannerView(
    onScannerResult: (iban) => {
    // do stuff here with the scanned iban
    },
),
```

Check out the example app for a possible usecase.
